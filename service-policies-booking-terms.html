        <h1>Service Policies & Booking Terms</h1>
        <p>
          Before booking or making an inquiry, please take a moment to review
          the following terms to ensure a smooth and seamless experience. Thank
          you!
        </p>
        <p>By booking, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions.</p>
        <h4>1. Booking Procedures</h4>
        <p>
          When scheduling a service, you may select your preferred time slot;
          however, availability is subject to current bookings. Exact times
          within a slot cannot be requested unless explicitly agreed upon by the
          cat sitter in writing. Once a time slot has been confirmed, changes
          cannot be made unless mutually agreed upon in writing.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Service Time Slots</h4>
        <p>
          Our services are organized into three designated time slots for your
          convenience:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Morning</strong>: 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM</li>
            <li><strong>Afternoon</strong>: 12:00 PM - 5:00 PM</li>
            <li><strong>Evening</strong>: 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="italic">Please note</span>: Bookings requested outside
          these designated times incur an additional charge of £5 per visit.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Meet & Greet Policy</h4>
        <p>
          A meet and greet is required within one week or less prior to your
          scheduled booking. During this meeting, clients must provide their
          spare key and ensure that parking arrangements are made in
          advance—either by having free parking available or by arranging a
          valid parking permit.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Access Requirements</h4>
        <p>
          All clients are required to provide a spare key for service access.
          The key will be securely held during the visit and returned upon your
          arrival. Without a spare key, we cannot accept your booking, and no
          refund will be issued.
        </p>
        <h4>5. Flea & Parasite Policy</h4>
        <p class="padding-bottom-1">
          For the wellbeing of all the cats I look after and to protect my own
          home and other clients' homes, I kindly ask that all cats are treated
          for fleas <strong>before any booking starts</strong>. This applies to
          <strong>both indoor and outdoor cats</strong>, as fleas and other
          parasites can be brought in on shoes, clothing, or other pets. I'm not
          asking for anything complicated or expensive, a basic store-bought
          spot-on treatment (the kind you apply behind the neck/shoulders) is
          absolutely fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, during the booking, I notice signs of fleas, worms, or any other
          parasites and there's no treatment available in the home, I'll
          purchase it myself and you'll need to reimburse me. If this isn't
          agreed to, or the issue goes untreated, I may have to end the booking
          early, as I can't risk passing anything on to other cats or homes I
          visit. This policy is simply in place to keep everyone, including your
          own cat.
        </p>
        <h4>6. Client Conduct</h4>
        <p>
          Respectful behaviour is essential. Any form of harassment, bullying,
          or behaviour that compromises the safety and well-being of our cat
          sitter will result in the immediate refusal of service.
        </p>
        <h4>7. Adherence to Agreed Time Slots & Change Requests</h4>
        <p>
          Clients are expected to adhere to the agreed-upon time slot. While you
          may request changes, such requests are at the sole discretion of the
          cat sitter and are not guaranteed. We will strive to accommodate
          change requests where possible, but flexibility is not a right.
        </p>
        <h4>8. Visit Requirements & Additional Instructions</h4>
        <p class="padding-bottom-1">
          Any tasks outside the agreed visit description will incur extra
          charges, and all cleaning supplies, food, and other relevant items
          must be shown at the meet and greet and kept easily accessible. Visit
          instructions and additional requirements must be provided in writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each visit is scheduled for 20-25 minutes and will not be extended to
          accommodate feeding unless specifically requested in advance, in which
          case extra charges may apply; please ensure all tasks can be completed
          within the allotted time or request a longer visit as needed.
        </p>
        <h4>9. Cancellation Rights - Client Misconduct</h4>
        <p>
          Our cat sitter reserves the right to cancel any booking immediately if
          a client engages in misconduct, including harassment, bullying, or any
          behaviour that compromises the safety and well-being of the cat
          sitter. This right also applies if a client fails to honour any
          agreements made at the time of booking.
        </p>
        <h4>10. Cancellation Policy</h4>
        <p>
          The cancellation policy for Cats and Kittens Sitter is as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>14+ Days Notice</strong>: If cancellation is given in
              writing 14 days or more prior to the booking, there will be no
              charge (full refund).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>13 to 8 Days Notice</strong>: If cancellation is given in
              writing between 13 and 8 days prior to the booking, a charge of
              25% applies (75% refund).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>7 Days to 48 Hours Notice</strong>: If cancellation is
              given in writing between 7 days and 48 hours prior to the booking,
              a charge of 50% applies (50% refund).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Less Than 48 Hours Notice</strong>: If cancellation is
              given in writing less than 48 hours prior to the booking, the full
              fee will be charged (no refund).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Service Non-availability</strong>: In the unlikely event
              that we cannot honour your booking, your full payment will be
              refunded (full refund).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Early Return or Non-Adherence</strong>: If you arrive home
              earlier than expected or fail to adhere to the booking timings and
              terms, you will not be refunded for the remaining visits.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          In the unlikely event that the primary sitter is unavailable due to
          holiday, illness, or an unforeseen emergency, a trusted and fully
          insured substitute sitter may attend the visits as scheduled. The
          substitute sitter will be fully briefed on the pet's care routine and
          any specific instructions to ensure consistency and quality of care.
          Clients will be informed as soon as possible should a substitute
          sitter be required.
        </p>
        <h4>Content Usage Rights</h4>
        <p>
          By booking cat sitting services with Cats and Kittens Sitter, you
          consent to the use of photos and/or videos of your cat(s) on our
          social media platforms and promotional materials.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Content will only feature your cat(s) and will never include
              personal information such as client's names, addresses, faces, or
              identifiable features of your home.
            </li>
            <li>
              This content is used to highlight the care and joy provided to
              pets in our service and to promote responsible pet care.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="padding-bottom-1">
          If you do not wish for your cat(s) to appear in any media, you must
          notify us in writing (e.g., email or message) before your booking.
        </p>
        <p class="padding-bottom-1">
          In the absence of such notice, your booking will be considered
          explicit consent for this use.
        </p>
