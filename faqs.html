              How Often Should a Cat Sitter Visit My Cat?

            <p>
              When planning time away from home, one of the most important
              decisions for any cat owner is how often a sitter should visit.
              The answer
              <strong
                >depends on your cat's routine, age, personality, and
                health</strong
              >. At Cats & Kittens Sitter, we tailor our visits to suit every
              cat's unique needs.

              <h2>Daily Visits Are Essential</h2>
              <p>
                Most cats should be checked on
                <strong>at least once a day</strong>. This ensures they have
                fresh food and water, and a clean litter tray. Most importantly,
                there is someone to check on their health and well-being. Cats
                are independent, but they can still get lonely, stressed, or
                sick and issues can escalate quickly if left unnoticed.
              </p>
              <h2>Twice Daily Visits for Social or Vulnerable Cats</h2>
              <p class="padding-bottom-1">
                If your cat is particularly
                <strong
                  >social, elderly, a kitten, or requires medication</strong
                >, we recommend <strong>two visits per day</strong>. These cats
                benefit from more frequent contact to maintain their routine.
                Like receiving medication at the right time, or the emotional
                reassurance they need while you're away.

              <h2 class="padding-top-1">Visit Duration Matters Too</h2>
              <p>
                At Cats & Kittens Sitter, we offer two different visit lengths
                (we'll always offer advice if you're unsure what's best):
              </p>
              <div class="center-div">
                <ul>
                  <li>Standard: <strong>20-25 minute visits</strong></li>
                  <li>Extended: <strong>40-45 minute visits</strong></li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <h2 class="padding-top-1">Can You Do More Than Two Visits?</h2>
              <p>
                Yes, we can offer <strong>up to three visits per day</strong> if
                needed, depending on your location and our availability. In rare
                or exceptional circumstances we
                <strong>may be able to offer four visits per day</strong>, but
                this is subject to discussion and scheduling.
              </p>
              <h2>Tailored to Your Cat's Routine</h2>
              <p>
                Every cat is different. Some prefer short, calm visits. Others
                enjoy extended play and cuddles. We take your cat's feeding
                routine, medication schedule, and personality into account when
                planning our care. That's why it is
                <strong>important</strong> when enquiring, to
                <strong>share details</strong> about their feeding routine,
                behaviour, and any special requirements. This way
                <strong>
                  we can make sure the visit plan you've chosen suits their
                  needs perfectly </strong

              As a professional cat sitter in London, your cat's health and well
              being is my top priority. During every visit, I carefully monitor
              your cat's behaviour, appetite, litter box habits, and overall
              mood.

                If I notice anything concerning, I will contact you first to
                discuss it. When needed, I may also call your vet for advice to
                help decide whether a visit is necessary. I will never take your
                cat to the vet without your knowledge, unless it is a genuine
                emergency and time is critical.

              Before booking or making an inquiry, please take a moment to
              review the following terms to ensure a smooth and seamless
              experience. Thank you!

              <h4>1. Booking Procedures</h4>
              <p>
                When scheduling a service, you may select your preferred time
                slot; however, availability is subject to current bookings.
                Exact times within a slot cannot be requested unless explicitly
                agreed upon by the cat sitter in writing. Once a time slot has
                been confirmed, changes cannot be made unless mutually agreed
                upon in writing.
              </p>
              <h4>2. Service Time Slots</h4>
              <p>
                Our services are organized into three designated time slots for
                your convenience:
              </p>
              <div class="center-div">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Morning</strong>: 7:00 AM - 12:00 PM</li>
                  <li><strong>Afternoon</strong>: 12:00 PM - 5:00 PM</li>
                  <li><strong>Evening</strong>: 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p class="not-for-job-app">
                Please note: Bookings requested outside these designated times
                incur an additional charge of £3 per visit.
              </p>

              <h2>3. Meet & Greet Policy</h2>
              <p>
                A meet and greet is required within one week or less prior to
                your scheduled booking. During this meeting, clients must
                provide their spare key and ensure that parking arrangements are
                made in advance—either by having free parking available or by
                arranging a valid parking permit.
              </p>
              <h2>4. Access Requirements</h2>
              <p>
                All clients are required to provide a spare key for service
                access. The key will be securely held during the visit and
                returned upon your arrival. Without a spare key, we cannot
                accept your booking, and no refund will be issued.
              </p>
              <h2>5. Client Conduct</h2>
              <p>
                Respectful behaviour is essential. Any form of harassment,
                bullying, or behavior that compromises the safety and well-being
                of our cat sitter will result in the immediate refusal of
                service.
              </p>
              <h2>6. Adherence to Agreed Time Slots & Change Requests</h2>
              <p>
                Clients are expected to adhere to the agreed-upon time slot.
                While you may request changes, such requests are at the sole
                discretion of the cat sitter and are not guaranteed. We will
                strive to accommodate change requests where possible, but
                flexibility is not a right.
              </p>
              <h2>7. Visit Requirements & Additional Instructions</h2>
              <p>
                Any tasks outside the agreed visit description will incur extra
                charges, and all cleaning supplies, food, and other relevant
                items must be shown at the meet and greet and kept easily
                accessible. Visit instructions and additional requirements must
                be provided in writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each visit is scheduled for 25 minutes and will not be extended
                to accommodate feeding unless specifically requested in advance,
                in which case extra charges may apply; please ensure all tasks
                can be completed within the allotted time or request a longer
                visit as needed.
              </p>
              <h2>8. Cancellation Rights - Client Misconduct</h2>
              <p>
                Our cat sitter reserves the right to cancel any booking
                immediately if a client engages in misconduct, including
                harassment, bullying, or any behavior that compromises the
                safety and well-being of the cat sitter. This right also applies
                if a client fails to honour any agreements made at the time of
                booking.
              </p>
              <p class="padding-bottom-1">

              <p>
                Our cat sitter reserves the right to cancel any booking
                immediately if a client engages in misconduct, including
                harassment, bullying, or any behaviour that compromises the
                safety and well-being of the cat sitter. This right also applies
                if a client fails to honour any agreements made at the time of
                booking.
              </p>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Early Return or Non-Adherence</strong>: If you

                In the unlikely event that the primary sitter is unavailable due
                to holiday, illness, or an unforeseen emergency, a trusted and
                fully insured substitute sitter may attend the visits as
                scheduled. The substitute sitter will be fully briefed on the
                pet's care routine and any specific instructions to ensure
                consistency and quality of care. Clients will be informed as
                soon as possible should a substitute sitter be required.
